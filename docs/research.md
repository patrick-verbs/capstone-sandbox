### Adjustments to proposal
Feedback: Needs a clearer purpose for existing üòë

__What does a user have to gain from this?__
As it is, it's just a very general toolset. More like a feature set. I'd like users to be able to database their digital media assets in such a way that it's __easier to find them__ than with a file browser like Finder (Mac) or Explorer (Windows).

I need to scale down the scope.

#### Idea #1 research
File browsing app
- Keep it simple, it's just a file browser
- For stretch goals, it can store file locations (addresses on a user's specified device, or on the web)
- Users could attach metadata like licenses (for digital assets) and integrity checksums

__Has this been done? What need does this serve?__
- Nice little tutorial: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT97kQWf7wU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT97kQWf7wU)
  - Don't like that it's a desktop application. That limits its accessibility. It's also not on-curriculum enough (e.g. not a web app) to be a satisfying capstone demonstration for me.

__File browser web apps?__
- This is awesome: [https://webix.com/filemanager/](https://webix.com/filemanager/)
  - I kinda just want to use this as one feature of my app. It takes all the work out of building something that's PURELY for functionality
  - SCRATCH THAT. It's enterprise-level software that doesn't even have a price tag unless you consult them. Next.
- This looks promising: [https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser](https://github.com/filebrowser/filebrowser)
  - It's a web app (yay)
  - Should I just use this as a library/middleware for something bigger in scope and less boring than a file browser? üòï
  - Apache 2.0 license!

__Tech stack__
- JS/CSS/HTML?
  - There's almost nothing left to do if this file browser already exists... I don't want to just install a resource that makes up 75% of my project's code
  - The other 25% would be styling/presentation, and having a database
- Firestore database? MongoDB?

#### Idea #1 conclusion
- I don't think a simple file browser web app has enough __identity__ or __usefulness__
- While the "File Browser" library is insanely nice, and useful, it just leaves too little for me to do
- I could make my own from scratch
  - Resources:
    - [File on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File)
    - [File() on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File/File)
    - [File on W3C](https://w3c.github.io/FileAPI/)
    - [Working with files](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Working_with_files)
    - [IndexedDB API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API)
- I don't think this is "enough" for me to be happy with it. It's not even a feature, it's just a piece of functionality.
- Give this more "identity"

### Desired tech stack
- HTML5/CSS3
  - I want this to be a __web app__, not something a user needs to install
  - This limits options (which is good) &mdash; I don't want to use a relational database like MySQL because it wouldn't be lightweight enough for a web app
  - Time allowing, I want this damn thing to look GOOD
- React
  - I want the practice, and to have it in my portfolio
- Firebase/Firestore?
  - Definitely the path of least resistance
  - I'm not stoked about Google's [privacy violations and ongoing lawsuit in the state of California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firebase#User_privacy_controversies), but... when in Rome
  - Full CRUD

### Desired functionality or features
- Accessible design
- Mobile-first design (stretch)
- Deploy on web
- Deploy as an app (very much stretch)
- User registration, authentication, and authorization

### Simple ideas using all of the above
- A digital asset manager specifically for tracking licenses on various assets used in projects
  - example: you link two files from your computer to the app -- a pixel-art map with a CC0 license, and a pixel-art character with a GPL2.0 license; the app makes it easy to see the licenses, and possibly warns of conflicts
    - this actually implies creating __project__ pages, or at least having a dedicated table for projects in the database -- many projects (created by users) can have many assets
    - this would also have to implement a file browser... __so shouldn't a user be able to find files/assets based on their license?__ Wouldn't that be useful?
  - the "identity" of this feels too broad. Is this for __any__ licensed digital asset? What user is going to say "oh, nice, I need this"?
    - I don't want to scope this down to a specific type of asset (like game-making assets) because that limits its usefulness, too üòë
    - is this essentially a media browser, like iTunes? But a little more transparent and collaborative about licensing (projects === playlists, essentially?) whereas iTunes enforces DRM (same thing fundamentally)

### Original proposal (unapproved)

Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?)
Allow users to create accounts for tracking their digital media assets (e.g. ebooks, movies, game-creation assets) and projects that use them. Users can share their media asset libraries as sortable lists on a profile page, which have robust sorting/listing options like ‚Äúby author,‚Äù ‚Äúby release date,‚Äù ‚Äúby fictional chronology,‚Äù etc. ‚Äî these lists are structurally similar to iTunes playlists; they can be made either manually or procedurally (with a granular search akin to the iTunes ‚ÄúSmart Playlist‚Äù). Assets can be mapped to a local directory (private to each user for their own use), which allows two major benefits: easier launching of assets using this app rather than navigating through system folders, and logging hashing checksums (MD5 & SHA1, as well as more secure SHA2) to verify file integrity over time. Assets can also have their licenses tracked, so that users can group them in a list for projects and see all included licenses at a glance.

Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
Why do I do this to myself
